WordpressShortcodes
===================

Add a shortcodes drop down on the Wordpress TinyMCE editor

Yes, I know this is part of a tutorial but hey, I'm not a programmer so relax.

You will see loads of coding errors so please be nice :) I can include your suggested changes to the code. If it doesn't break it :)

So if you wan't to contribute, I'll be very happy to see the outcome of this.

Many thanks
