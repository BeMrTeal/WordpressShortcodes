WordpressShortcodes
===================

This adds a shortcodes drop down on the Wordpress TinyMCE editor.

I needed an array of shorcodes that would be replaced by images. I've got it working and I know it isn't the optimal code and that it came from a tutorial. But hey, I'm not a programmer so relax. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The original tutorial can be found here: http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/guide-to-creating-your-own-wordpress-editor-buttons--wp-30182

You will see loads of coding errors so please be nice :)
I can include your suggested changes to the code. If it doesn't break it of course :)

So if you wan't to contribute, I'll be very happy to see the outcome of this.

Many thanks
